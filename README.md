# Compass community

## 👩‍🏫 Web Service
```
Compass Community is a web application for international students to get information 
regarding studying abroad prior to studying abroad or while they are on it.
People can post their stories and questions and can receive cheerful comments and actions. 
The main feature of this web app is to share each other’s experiences since as an international student, 
it is always hard to gather information in advance. 
This website will help them to get prepared and feel relieved about studying abroad.
